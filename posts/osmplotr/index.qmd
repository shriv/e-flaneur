I became interested in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of urban form over a year ago. However, learning a useful set of foundational skills was elusive for some time as I didn't know where to start. A chance watch of Bimal Patel's slides and narrative of urban form in Indian cities [@AlainBertaudBimal] fired up my imagination and set out a simple path to pick up new skills. Architects like Bimal Patel dominate the vast literature of urban form and their classic set of explanatory images are 200m - 500m square schematics of building footprints, plots and street networks.

However, there was no tutorial (that I could find) or even examples for creating these in R making it a great learning project. After some googling around for existing code or packages that would help me build the required schematics in a systematic way, I landed on the following franken-hack: 

- Specifying a bounding box with consistent extent based on a user specification. This code was taken from `spacey` [@SpaceyEasilyObtain] instead of writing equivalent code myself. The functions `get_centroid_bounding_box()`, `extract_coords()`, `rad_to_deg()` and `deg_to_rad()` are needed. 
- Using `osmplotr` [@RopensciOsmplotr2022] to pull specific spatial elements like parks, building networks and street works and print a visually consistent map. 
- Using `patchwork` [@ComposerPlots] to put together multiple schematics for side by side comparison.
