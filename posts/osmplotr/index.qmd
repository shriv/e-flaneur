I became interested in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of urban form over a year ago. Architects like Bimal Patel [@AlainBertaudBimal] dominate the vast literature of urban form and their classic set of explanatory images are 200m - 500m square schematics of building footprints, plots and street networks. However, there was no tutorial (that I could find) or even examples for creating these in R.

![An example of comparative urban form schematics from [@WhatUrbanFabric2012].](urban-form.jpeg){width="100%"}

After some googling around for existing code or packages that would help me build the required schematics in a systematic way, I landed on the following franken-hack:

-   Specifying a bounding box with consistent extent based on a user specification. The code for this functionality was taken from `spacey` [@SpaceyEasilyObtain]. The functions `get_centroid_bounding_box()`, `extract_coords()`, `rad_to_deg()` and `deg_to_rad()` are needed. I keep them in a local R script since I don't need the other functionality of `spacey`.
-   Using `osmplotr` [@RopensciOsmplotr2022] to pull specific spatial elements like parks, building networks and street works and print a visually consistent map. The handy `make_osm_map()` function both gets the data and outputs the map as a `ggplot` object. Colours can be set for the different structures in the map.
-   Using `patchwork` [@ComposerPlots] to put together multiple `ggplot2` objects for side by side comparison.

```{r}
#| output: false
#| echo: true
#| out.width: 100%

# custom osmplotr function
return_osmplotr_map <- function(bbox, map_title){
  # get data
  structs <- c ("highway", "building", "park", "landuse")
  structures <- osm_structures (structures = structs, col_scheme = "dark")
  structures$value [4] <- "recreation_ground"
  structures$cols[4] <- "#647864FF"
  
  # make map
  osmplotr_map <- make_osm_map(structures = structures, bbox = bbox)
  plot <- osmplotr_map$map  + labs(title = map_title)
  return(plot)
}

# bounding boxes and extend with spacey function
pc_bbox <- get_centroid_bounding_box(
  c("lat" = 19.01879, "lng" = 72.85141),
  distance = 500,
  dist.unit = "m") %>% 
  get_bbox()

be_bbox <- get_centroid_bounding_box(
  c("lat" = 18.93566, "lng" = 72.8401),
  distance = 500,
  dist.unit = "m") %>% 
  get_bbox()

# return individual plot objects
p1 <- return_osmplotr_map(pc_bbox, "Parsi Colony, Dadar (Mumbai City)")
p2 <- return_osmplotr_map(be_bbox, "Ballard Estate, Fort (Mumbai City)")

# Compose plot
(p1 + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0,5,0,0), "pt"))) + (p2) 
```

```{r}
#| out-width: 100%
# Compose plot
(p1 + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0,5,0,0), "pt"))) + (p2) 
```
