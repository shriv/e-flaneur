This site is dedicated to learning urbanism through data science and research. The blog is a repository of raw thoughts and short technical lessons while essays are a synthesis of topics I come across in urbanism research. Everything here is my own personal opinion. I also write about [forests and the environment](https://shriv.github.io/forest-sense/) and [data science](https://shriv-portfolio.netlify.app/).
