    "title": "Getting GIS data of Mumbai slums",
    "section": "",
    "text": "According the 2011 census, around 42% of the population resides in slums [1]. Given the rapid rates of growth in a megacity like Mumbai, it’s likely that both the extent and the population of slum residents has only increased in the last decade. While the source of the GIS data is also several years old (circa 2015) [2], we can use it to understand the more about slums in the city. I have a long list of questions for quantitative understanding how slums are part of the urban fabric:\n\nSlum concentrations around the city?\nHow large are individual slums?\nHow big are slum clusters?\nWhat type of urban typologies exist between and next to slums?\nHow did slums evolve in various parts of the city?\n\nAlongside the quantitative aspects also come the qualitative: how did slums start, how do they continue despite such incredible difficulties of life and what is their future?\nLike many sources of data from India, the original data from the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) [2] is provided as a pdf map and a separate set of attributes also in pdf. This adds yet another item on my growing list of required R geospatial skills for urban analytics: converting pdf maps to digital shapefiles. However, I can defer this lesson for a little longer thanks to Opencity [3] who have digitised the map to a KML format that can be directly read in as an sf object.\nAs a first step, I’m trying to get a sense of the extent of slums across the city. I’ve added key natural areas (in green) since Mumbai has several wetland areas and a large national park within the city boundaries. Slums (in red) are mostly distributed in Mumbai suburban district of Mumbai with a few exceptions like the well-known slum of Dharavi at the northwestern boundary of Mumbai city district. Given the extensive spread of slums, understanding how they dovetail with middle class and upper class urban typologies will be a key focus of my future analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] C.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Mumbai is a city of incredible heterogeneity and diversity. One of the many indicators of this aspect is how and where people live. To answer questions of where people live, we can either find census information per ward or other spatially resolved sources. Census information is unfortunately rather out of date, over 12 years old [1], so an alternative source is required.\nThe search led me to WorldPop [2] which provides population counts at a 100m\\(^2\\) spatial resolution. While the WorldPop estimates use clever statistical models for generating spatial distribution of population, the total for Mumbai comes to 13.38 million people as at 2020 [3]. This value is 25% lower than the recent 2023 population estimate of 17.2 million from the Indian government [1]. It is likely that the mismatch results from the Indian population being generated from a generic top-down model that covers the world while the Indian government has projected population using past trends in growth rates specific to the area.\nDespite low confidence in its accuracy, the WorldPop dataset was a good opportunity to learn how to wrangle raster data and to combine it with vector data. The population data from WorldPop covers the entire country so cropping to the Mumbai boundaries (full and by the two main districts) was required before any plotting or analysis. After some initial confusion over which package to use, I found that the R package stars [4] is a very convenient way to read raster data into R and the geom_stars geom allows for easy plotting with ggplot2. Usefully, st_crop also works out of the box when combining polygon sf objects with a stars object.\nSeparating the population counts for the two districts of Mumbai, draws attention apparent homogeneity of Mumbai city. This corresponds well to the more business-centric landuse of Mumbai city especially at the southern tip of Colaba. The northern and eastern areas of Mumbai suburban are significantly more populated than the city district, and are spatially congruous with extensive slum settlements though the population estimates smear out the higher density of slums beyond the expected slum limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] C.

    "text": "I rely heavily on Openstreetmap (OSM) for my geospatial analyses as I mainly work with vector data of buildings and streets. However, OSM is not always reliable - with particularly large issues for cities in developing countries like Mumbai. From my recent investigations, OSM seems especially bad for building footprints in areas with informal settlements or changes within the last few years. To learn more, I’ve compared OSM with a recent dataset called GlobalML from Microsoft [1]. Instructions on downloading data from Global ML can be found in another blog post.\n\n\n\nI first started with comparing OSM and Google maps streetviews centered around the area I grew up in (Sector 2, Vashi). I could quickly see that many buildings were missing in the footprints data. Global ML corroborates this especially for areas with many small building footprints - likely informal settlements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation is worse for known vast informal settlement areas like Shivaji Nagar in Eastern Mumbai suburban district. Here, OSM has not captured any building footprints but the whole area is densely built up! What’s even more fascinating is that this area has been built up for quite some time [2]. It would seem that OSM built environment polygons are not regularly maintained for Mumbai?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] Microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints. Microsoft, 2023.

    "text": "I’ve recently learned of the GlobalML dataset from Microsoft [1] which has extracted building footprints from satellite imagery. However, accessing the data is not trivial as only a handful of countries have specific data releases. The rest of the world, including India, are available as compressed files and can be downloaded using the quadkey for the required map tile.\nThe challenge I faced was figuring out which quadkey tile contained the latitude and longitudes I was interested in. Luckily, I found a very useful snippet [2] that makes use of the pyquadkey2 python package.\n\npython3 -m pip install pyquadkey2\npython3\n\n\nfrom pyquadkey2 import quadkey\n\ndef geo_to_qk(latitude, longitude, zoom_level):\n    \"\"\"Convert latitude and longitude to quadkey at specified\n    integer  zoom level, returning quadkey as a string\n    \"\"\"\n    qk = str(quadkey.from_geo((latitude, longitude), zoom_level))\n    return qk\n\n# To get a 9 digit quadkey, the zoom level is 9\ngeo_to_qk(19.07403, 72.99571, 9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GlobalML data tiles are based on zoom level 9 so once I had the requisite quadkey (123300311), I just had to look up the file containing it in the data links csv, to get the following link: https://minedbuildings.blob.core.windows.net/global-buildings/2022-11-15/global-buildings.geojsonl/RegionName%3DIndia/quadkey%3D123300311/part-00055-2cb4a5ad-6652-48b0-a336-f09518f4c9e5.c000.csv.gz\nFor some unknown reason, the geojson file is saved as csv. So, once the csv.gz is downloaded and extracted, the file needs to be renamed from .csv to .geojson before being read into R with sf::st_read(). A quick visualisation shows that the tile gets footprints for Mumbai suburban district and the wider metropolitan region to the east. A different tile will be required for the Mumbai city district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints. Microsoft, 2023. Accessed: Feb. 06, 2023. [Online].

Architects like Bimal Patel [1] dominate the vast literature of urban form and their classic set of explanatory images are 200m - 500m square schematics of building footprints, plots and street networks. However, there was no tutorial (that I could find) or even examples for creating these in R.\n\n\n\nAn example of comparative urban form schematics from [2].\n\n\nAfter some googling around for existing code or packages that would help me build the required schematics in a systematic way, I landed on the following franken-hack:\n\nSpecifying a bounding box with consistent extent based on a user specification. The code for this functionality was taken from spacey [3]. The functions get_centroid_bounding_box(), extract_coords(), rad_to_deg() and deg_to_rad() are needed.

    "text": "One of the many stereotypes of Mumbai is that it is a city filled with abject poverty and slums wherever you look. While slums are a deeply intrinsic part of Mumbai’s urban reality, given their extensive spread, the city also has many beautiful spaces where people live and work amidst comfortable and beautiful urban environs. Here we look briefly at two such areas: the residential Parsi Colony in Dadar [1] and the business district of Ballard Estate in Fort [2].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParsi colony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBallard Estate\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth neighbourhoods are planned designs from the British era of the early twentieth century where buildings were designed accommodate the available plot of land. The urban skeletons of both neighbourhoods have a pleasing flow even within unusual plot shapes. Parsi Colony takes it further by incorporating green space in different shapes within the overall design.\nI’m particularly interested in understanding how people lived in and moved about these neighbourhoods and contrast it with my own lived experience within a very different neighbourhood in the urban sprawl of Navi Mumbai.

    "section": "",
    "text": "When I wrote my earlier posts on urban form schematics (see here and here), I was unaware that they are known as figure-ground diagrams - whose main purpose is to highlight built and unbuilt space. The contrast is also referred to as the mass vs. the void or, the figure vs. the ground. Only buildings are included in the conventional version - resulting in a stark mosaic of black and white that allows for a bird’s eye analysis of urban form and structures. Note, I have reversed the colour scheme from my other posts to follow the common style of figure-ground diagrams.\nSquare mile comparisons of different urban areas (or the same area across time) feature extensively in the book Great Streets by Allan Jacobs [1] according to [2] but I don’t know if this is a widely followed convention. Given the highly heterogenous urban mosaic of Mumbai, smaller areas are more meaningful as they represent a consistently designed space. For this reason, I have maintained the 500m bounding box around a central coordinate like the previous posts.\nWithout the street network or parks coloured in, the urban fabric of Dadar Parsi Colony and Ballard Estate appear more similar to each other than to the examples from the Upper West Side and Islington. The famous rectangular blocks of New York City are a stark contrast to the more sinuous blocks of British (local and colonial) urbanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the more conventional figure-ground diagram ignores the street network [3], the combination of streets and buildings offers more insights - especially when the street widths in the diagram are a tentative approximation of street importance [2]. For example, primary and trunk roads are given the largest widths followed by medium widths for secondary and tertiary roads and light lines for all others. This allows for qualitative analysis of urban mobility like walkability and connectivity overlaid with building densities of residence and / or commerce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, NYC stands out, compared to the examples of British urbanism, where secondary or tertiary roads surround all blocks. In Islington and Dadar Parsi Colony, two residential neighbourhoods of British design, building blocks are mostly connected by residential roads with arterial connections at least 100m - 200m away.\nThere is much to analyse and understand from these diagrams and I hope to return to them many times over as I fumble my way through the vast literature of urban morphology. I am also trying to figure out how to add scale bars back into the schematics in a visually congruent way - my efforts so far have been too messy for inclusion.\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] A. B.

    "text": "Building heights are an important indicator for various urban analyses - from population / m\\(^{2}\\) to Floor Area Ratio (FAR). However, getting this data is not easy. Building polygons in OpenStreetMap usually don’t have this attribute unless it was part of a bulk upload and only some cities provide open data of building footprints with heights [1]. With time and skill, a digital elevation model from LIDAR data (or other sources of data) can be used to derive building heights.\nNone of these options are useful for a relative beginner in remote sensing interested in exploring urbanism of the Global South. Enter derived open data from academic papers. Here I look two datasets - average building heights in a 500m grid from [2] and 90m grid from [3]. Both datasets are cropped to the London polygon for further analysis.\nThe supplementary information in [2] provides a Figshare link to download a global dataset of average building heights in a 500 m\\(^{2}\\) grid area. The centre of London and the Canary Wharf areas show heights of 20m - which are considerably lower than the heights of actual buildings (100 - 300m), While this dataset is not useful for analysis pertaining to buildings, it is useful for comparing built-up volumes derived from the average built-up heights as done in the paper. The data could also be useful for demarcating areas with higher proportions of tall buildings vs. medium height vs. single family homes.\nA recent paper by Esch et al. [3] described a methdology for deriving building heights for the established World Settlement Footprints data suite [4]. The higher granularity of this dataset, 90 m\\(^{2}\\), brings grid average heights much closer to real world building heights. However, the visual patterns of urbanisation at a city scale are lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to zoom in to borough or MSOA (Middle Super Output Area) to better visualise areas with tall buildings. In City of London, we easily see higher granularity of the cluster around Liverpool Street that contains the Shard, the tallest building in London. Similarly, the zoom over the Canary Wharf business cluster shows the spread of areas with many tall buildings over 100m (list here). The value of the grid cell is pretty close to the building heights though not exact as it is still an average and likely that the grid cell doesn’t always overlap fully with the building footprint of a tall building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] “NYC Building Heights.” https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Building-Heights/pffy-49n3 (accessed Mar. 18, 2023).\n\n\n[2] Y.

The centre of London and the Canary Wharf areas show heights of 20m - which are considerably lower than the heights of actual buildings (100 - 300m), While this dataset is not useful for analysis pertaining to buildings, it is useful for comparing built-up volumes derived from the average built-up heights as done in the paper. The data could also be useful for demarcating areas with higher proportions of tall buildings vs. medium height vs. single family homes."

The higher granularity of this dataset, 90\\(m^{2}\\), brings grid average heights much closer to real world building heights. However, the patterns of urbanisation at a city scale are lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to do zoom in at a borough or MSOA (Middle Super Output Area) to better visualise areas with tall buildings. In City of London, we easily see the cluster around Liverpool Street that contains the Shard, the tallest building in London. Similarly, we can zoom in to the Canary Wharf business cluster to see a spread of many tall buildings over 100m (list here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] “NYC Building Heights.” https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Building-Heights/pffy-49n3 (accessed Mar. 18, 2023).\n\n\n[2] Y.

    "text": "In the previous post, I quickly looked at two options for global building height rasters. The 90m grid from [1] looked more useful option the lower granularity provided more realistic values of real-world building heights. However, finding suitable data is only the first baby step. Figuring out how to calculate derived metrics like Floor Area Ratio (FAR) or population density per built area requires multiple datasets in different formats.\nFor FAR we can either associate the building footprint area to a raster cell, or associate an average building height per building polygon. To better understand which option is more suitable, we first overlay the rasters for City of London (full MSOA) and a portion of the Tower Hamlets MSOA around the Canary Wharf area.\nWhen preparing the data for the following maps, I learned a couple of useful tips:\n\nDissolving boundary polygons to the outer boundary needs st_make_valid() after the group by to ensure a clean polygon with no straggling lines within the dissolved polygon.\n\n\nboundaries_sf %>% \n  group_by(`higher boundary name`) %>% \n  st_make_valid() %>%\n  st_union() %>% \n  st_as_sf()\n\n\nUse st_intersection(poly1, poly2) to cleanly crop poly1 to the boundary of poly2.\n\nIn all my previous posts, I’ve stuck with the graphics workhorse, ggplot2. However, in this post I transitioned to the tmap package [2] and I highly recommend it. I am a relatively new user so I still don’t know whether it’s as comprehensive as ggplot2 but so far many of the map conversions have come out considerably better (and with simpler code) with tmap. Furthermore, tmap has two modes - where the same map can be viewed as static (tmap_mode(\"plot\")) or interactive (tmap_mode(\"view\")).\nNow coming back to the original question of FAR calculation options. The maps show that building polygons are of comparable size or much smaller than the raster cells and both datasets are quite mis-aligned. The building-centric option could be more useful - especially if we want to also associate a population to an area from a raster dataset like WorldPop [3]. It would be easier to assign a proportion of population to a building than trying to align two raster grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] T.
