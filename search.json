It is also an attempt to reflect on our urban lives, transformations and memories."

    "text": "The Mumbai of 2022 is estimated as a roaring megacity of a population anywhere between 18 and 25 million people Demographia (2022). A simple population count is difficult to pin down since the last census was in 2011and due to the pandemic it’s unclear whether the 2021 census has even happened\nTen years ago, the recorded population of the Mumbai metropolitan region was 18.4 million. The island city recorded a population 12.4 million - with 9.4 million in Mumbai suburban and 3.1 million in Mumbai City. The remaining population is spread across the metropolitan region on mainland - including the nearby exurb planned city turned to urban sprawl called Navi Mumbai where I grew up.\nMy attempts to find a more recent, spatially distributed estimates for the island city (rather than the metropolitan region) led me to the Worldpop estimations (Bondarenko et al. (2020)). Some clever statistical models that are calibrated against UNDP counts gives population estimates for Mumbai island in 2020 as 13.38 million people living in Mumbai (“The Spatial Distribution of Population in 2020 with Country Total Adjusted to Match the Corresponding UNPD Estimate, India” (2020)). The total splits 2.8 million to Mumbai city and 10.6 million to Mumbai suburban. These values are a little difficult to reconcile against the census from a decade prior as they note little increase and in the case of the city zone, population appears to have decreased!\n\n\n\nThe worldpop estimates even provide population counts at a 100m\\(^2\\) spatial resolution. Cropping the estimates to the two zones in the island city shows some interesting spatial patterns. For example, Mumbai city appears to be much more homogeneous in population density than Mumbai suburban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlattening the spatial population distribution reveals modalities as an overall pattern. In Mumbai City, the older southern part of the island, there are two distinct types of areas: those with population counts of ~250 people /100m\\(^2\\) and those with 50% more density ~375 people / 100m\\(^2\\). The larger zone of Mumbai suburban is more varied containing up to 4 modes - 2 in addition to the ones in Mumbai city. Whether these modes relate to specific urban typologies or if they are an artefact of the population count derivation model is still to be understand. Likely it is both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBondarenko, Maksym, David Kerr, Alessandro Sorichetta, and Andrew Tatem. 2020. “Census/Projection-Disaggregated Gridded Population Datasets, Adjusted to Match the Corresponding UNPD 2020 Estimates, for 183 Countries in 2020 Using Built-Settlement Growth Model (BSGM) Outputs.” University of Southampton. https://doi.org/10.5258/SOTON/WP00685.\n\n\nDemographia. 2022. “World Urban Areas.” http://demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf.\n\n\n“The Spatial Distribution of Population in 2020 with Country Total Adjusted to Match the Corresponding UNPD Estimate, India.” 2020. 2020. https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=49992."
