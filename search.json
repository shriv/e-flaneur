    "text": "My story begins in Mumbai. Now, in 2022, it is a roaring megacity of almost 21 million people. Though, we stutter here already with this simple fact. The last census was in 2011 and recorded a population of 18.4M for the metropolitan region and due to the pandemic it’s unclear whether the 2021 census has even happened. So, a ten year old population estimate for the island has recorded 12.4M with 9.4 M in Mumbai suburban and 3.1M in Mumbai. The remaining population is across the cities in the wider region including Navi Mumbai where I grew up.\nMy attempts to find a more recent estimate for the island city (rather than the metropolitan region) led me to the Worldpop estimations which even provide population counts at a 100m\\(^2\\) resolution. The latest estimate for 2020 using some clever models and adjustments to UN values gives Mumbai island at 14.5M in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlattening the spatial population distribution reveals modalities as an overall pattern. In Mumbai City, the older southern part of the island, there are two distinct types of areas: those with population counts of ~250 people /100m\\(^2\\) and those with 50% more density ~375 people / 100m\\(^2\\). The larger zone of Mumbai suburban is more varied containing up to 4 modes - 2 in addition to the ones in Mumbai city.\nWhether these modes relate to specific urban typologies or if they are an artefact of the population count derivation model is still to be understand. Likely it is both. The population counts are derived from an approximate typology.\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 64559 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values (geom_bar).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city bustles in some way every second of the day - rhythms rising, fading, cresting to a manic frenzy or just a staccato march. The beat of the place is bound to the people but the people too are constrained to their place. 20 million people squashed into an area just three quarters the area of New York city resulting in a crush of 20,000 people into one square kilometer. To put that into a realistic terms TODO - find one!"
